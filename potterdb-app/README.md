# PotterDB App

This project was made as educationnal purposes. Its goal is to practice fetching data from APIs (in this case, it's a REST API) and use it on a frontend website. The theme is "Harry Potter". You will find pages about the main characters of the franchise, the potions, the spells and the books.
